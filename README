ProcrastinatorsHelp
-------------------

"Procrastinator's Help" or "Save my time" or "Help me get things done" is a tool to stop you from
surfing to various time consuming websites you often visit. This is tool currently only runs under GNU/Linux
systems or with various tweaking (maybe) also under other operating systems.

The work principle is simple, you maintain two different access lists based on your /etc/hosts file
and disallow certain cites which you don't want to visit during certain hours for each day. So if
you are for instance a reddit addict then this will help you to force yourself to work on more
important stuff.


Requirements
------------

  o Ruby
  o GNU/Linux System
  o figlet


Examples
--------

See in the examples/ folder two simple hosts file examples which will redirect certain sites to
localhost if queried.
