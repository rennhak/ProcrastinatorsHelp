ProcrastinatorsHelp
-------------------

"Procrastinator's Help" or "Save my time" or "Help me get things done" is a tool to stop you from
surfing to various time consuming websites you often visit. This is tool currently only runs under GNU/Linux
systems or with various tweaking (maybe) also under other operating systems.

The work principle is simple, you maintain two different access lists based on your /etc/hosts file
and disallow certain cites which you don't want to visit during certain hours for each day. So if
you are for instance a reddit addict then this will help you to force yourself to work on more
important stuff.


Requirements
------------

  o Ruby
  o GNU/Linux System
  o GNU Figlet
  o (optional) www-servers/mini_httpd (e.g. v1.19) or similar simple local httpd daemon

  o diff
  o sudo
  o cp


Installation
------------

  o Copy the rb files in the lib/ folder to your $HOME/bin directory or where you keep your local bin files
  o Make sure that the local bin files are in your $PATH environment variable (to be found in your shell config file, e.g. .zshrc)
  o Add the "workmode" and the "playmode" aliases to your shell config file in the apropriate syntax (provided is zsh syntax)
  o Change the time inside the lib/checkworktimehosts.rb at line 15
    - "wts_hour" means "Work time start (hour)" 
    - "wts_min"  means "Work time start (min)"
    - "wte_hour" means "Work time end (hour)"
    - "wte_min"  means "Work time end (min)"

    Later versions of this software will make it easier to configure (more intuitive) and also allow
    exceptions e.g. on certain days etc.

  o Copy the modified and customized hosts.block and hosts.original to the /etc/. folder
  o Make sure you have installed all dependencies
  o If you didn't install all local webserver you will only get a resolve error in your browser. If
  you want to see a nice error message install a local webserver such as "www-servers/mini_httpd-1.19"
  and point it to the local www page you want to display.


Usage
-----

  o Open a console. The "checkworktimehosts.rb" script due to your shell hook found in bin/ will
  execute and check if the time is now "work" or "play". Depending on that it will check the hosts
  and replace if necessary.
  o If you want to force override this it requires you to enter your root password and display a
  figlet message. You can customize this to make it more difficult or disallow alltogether if you
  need to get things done.
    o ~% worktime   # switches to workmode and forces overwrite of /etc/hosts with hosts.block
    o ~% playtime   # switches to playmode and forces overwrite of /etc/hosts with hosts.original


Result
------

Now you should be able to get some work done from e.g. 10AM to 8PM  -  d(o_o)P


Examples
--------

See in the examples/ folder two simple hosts file examples which will redirect certain sites to
localhost if queried.

The switch from work to play or vice versa is checked everytime depending on your clock, settings and if you open a console.
